# Road-Transport-Authority-Database-system

This is a relational database for a transportation authority of a medium-sized city (e.g., RTA of Sharjah).

Analysis:
There are many buses owned by the authority. The buses operate on routes of the transportation network. As a part of the transportation network, a list of bus stops has already been identified. There are several routes in the network where each bus is assigned to exactly one route. On the other hand, there may be multiple buses operating on the same route. A route consists of a sequence of enumerated stops. The first and last of stops of each route are called its terminals. 

Overall, this project simulates a comprehensive database designed to efficiently manage various aspects of a public transportation system. The system encompasses key entities such as routes, buses, passengers, rides, bus drivers, and bus stops, creating a robust framework for organizing, storing, and retrieving information. The database facilitates seamless tracking of bus routes, their associated stops, and the buses operating on these routes. It maintains a detailed record of passengers, their identification, and their corresponding rides, ensuring an integrated approach to public transportation data management. With a focus on scalability and data integrity, the project aims to provide a reliable foundation for the dynamic and evolving requirements of a public transportation network.
