# Road-Transport-Authority-Database-system

This is a relational database for a transportation authority of a medium-sized city (e.g., RTA of Sharjah). Here is the analysis.
There are many buses owned by the authority. The buses operate on routes of the transportation network. As a part of the transportation network, a list of bus stops has already been identified. There are several routes in the network where each bus is assigned to exactly one route. On the other hand, there may be multiple buses operating on the same route. A route consists of a sequence of enumerated stops. The first and last of stops of each route are called its terminals.
